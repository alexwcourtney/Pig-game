Pig Rules:

- This game supports 2 players, each taking turns
- In each player's turn, the player is able to roll a six-sided die as many times as they'd like.  Each roll is added to their current round's score.
- However, if a player rolls a 1, their round's score is forefit, and the next player goes.
- The player can, at any time their current round's score is greater than 0, opt to 'Hold', which adds their current round's score to their total score and changes turns.
- The first player to 100 points in their total score wins the game.
